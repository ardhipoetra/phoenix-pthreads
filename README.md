# Phoenix Benchmark #

This repository is based on the Phoenix-2.0 tests/ directory:
  https://github.com/kozyraki/phoenix/tree/master/phoenix-2.0/tests

We adapt Phoenix to build under different configurations. They are stored
in config/ dir. The default configuration is "gcc", others inherit from it.

There is also a script "copyinputs.sh" to download inputs for benchmarks.
